	// Place your snippets for typescriptreact here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"React component": {
		"body": [
			"export interface $1Props {}",
			"",
			"export function $1(props: $1Props) {",
			"  return <></>;",
			"}",
		],
		"description": "A basic react component"
	},
	"React component with children": {
		"body": [
			"export type $1Props = React.PropsWithChildren<{}>",
			"",
			"export function $1({ children }: $1Props) {",
			"  return <>{children}</>;",
			"}",
		],
		"description": "A basic react component with children"
	}
